## Development Tools

### Location Testing
For testing location features during development, use our Chrome launcher script:

```bash
chmod +x launch-chrome.sh
./launch-chrome.sh
```

This script launches Chrome with the necessary flags to enable geolocation on IP addresses.

### Quick Development Setup
Use our development starter script:

```bash
chmod +x start-dev.sh
./start-dev.sh
```
